		<h5>Admission Criteria – Grade XI to XII</h5>
		<p>We at DPS Agra aim to ensure that students not only excel at academics but are also imbued with social and ethical values, skill sets and a positive attitude to contribute meaningfully to society. While the tests and interaction assess proficiency in English, Mathematics and Science, they also reveal the child’s problem-solving skills. Portions integrated in the admission process also examine the applicant's belief and value system on the basis of which he / she makes decisions and the way he / she handles and negotiates with the external world. Thus, our method of testing a student has been designed in such a way that we can look at him / her holistically. Please note that for Session 2019-20, admission is being offered only in classes Nursery, Prep and XI. There may be a few seats available in other classes against transfer out cases. Parents may submit an email request on <i style="color: blue">office@dps.ac.in</i>. The registration form would only be issued against vacancies if any.</p>
