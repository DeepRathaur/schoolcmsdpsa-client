		<p class="fnt14">Efforts are made at all times to ensure that all students start speaking in English as early as possible. At DPS Agra we recognize the socio-cultural background of our students and that is the reason why spoken English classes form a part of the routine Time Table and the School Assembly. To improve communication skills students are given every opportunity to present passages, poems, scriptures, extempore speeches, quizzes, etc in English. However, we seek active participation of the parents in this regard. We suggest that they should speak in English at home and encourage their wards to speak in English too. The child should be provided with age appropriate English books, newspapers and magazines. All students are given an English newspaper or periodical daily. This fosters good reading habit and propagates awareness building skills.</p>
