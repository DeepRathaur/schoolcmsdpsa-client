		<!--learning disablity -->
		<div class="contentHolder" *ngIf="five">
			<div >
				<p>A child with a learning disability is said to <b><i>"learn differently"</i></b>. Early identification and remedial teaching using multi-sensory techniques helps a child overcome his/her difficulties to a very large extent.</p>

<p>Famous personalities like Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, Leonardo-da-Vinci and Albert Einstein all had difficulty in learning to read and write. So it is of utmost importance that we not only help the child to learn differently but also identify his/her strengths and provide proper training and guidance so that he/she may excel in life.</p>

<p>We at DPS Agra ensure that all children get individual attention they deserve so that we may identify their strengths and challenges and work towards making each child a successful human being.</p>
